# Problem 5

However, when trying to return an array of hashmaps in the contract, I constantly encountered the following error:
```
Types containing (nested) mappings can only be parameters or return variables of internal or library functions.
```
Hence, I created a slight workaround in `./'Problem 5'/test.js` such that the return value of the console logged value from the JS file would be in the required format:
```json
[
  {
    token: "0x123d475e13aa54a43a7421d94caa4459da021c77",
    balance: "9988887462734227" // its okay if this is typed ethers.BigNumber
  },
  {
    token: "0x55f6823de9642f47e80ed4845a55aa8430cb4ec6",
    balance: "899998285714286"
  },
  â€¦
]
```
